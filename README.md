## Overview
I am going to build a website for homemade accessories store 'Sew Animals'. A user will be able to browse their products, and have a list of favorite animals and themes.

I will build the front and back end using JS, React, Bootstrap, and Prisma.

## User Stories
- 01 As a user, so I can save by preferences, allow me to **create an account and login**
- 02 As a user, so I get to see items I might be interested in, let me pick several **tags** of my **favorite animals**
- 03 As an owner, so I can keep my track of my items, let me assign them a **category**
- 04 As an owner, so I can make my items easier to find, let me **add tags** describing them
